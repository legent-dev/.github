## Hi there 👋

LEGENT is a platform for language-interactive embodied agents.

The platform is dedicated to creating future robots capable of talking, seeing, and acting based on large embodied models from virtual game world to real world.
We aspire to democratize the research of large embodied models, enabling everyone interested to study this field without barriers. Let's start our journey!
